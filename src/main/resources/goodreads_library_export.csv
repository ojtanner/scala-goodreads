Sign me the f*ck up!<br/><br/>What we get is a story taking place in a backwater village on a backwater planet conquered a few decades ago by a spacefaring empire. Much akin to the Imperium in 40k the empire uses archaic technology that seems to have more in common with magic than laws of physics. So far so good. Sound just like my coup of tea. Revolution against impossible odds.<br/><br/>However, once i actually got to reading the book i realised, that the concepts and stories in this book are more interesting to talk about than to read about:<br/><br/>- The plot is interesting, but the author does not make good use of it. I never got fully hooked, even tough on paper it sounds incredibly fun. Overthrowing an oppressive regime while trying to escape a planet that is bound to be destroyed by a pulverized moon? Hell yeah!<br/><br/>- The characters are bland and forgettable. This does not have to be a dealbreaker if the story is good enough to pull you in on it's own. But like i said: cool idea, not so great execution. Paired with the not-so-interesting characters we get a story that drags more than it flies by. Thankfully the book is relatively short, or else i would have given it a 2.5/5.<br/><br/>- The world is not all that immersive. I usually have a pretty vivid imagination while reading. But i did have trouble actually visualizing whatever was going on during the book. If i had to guess, i would say that the way the author describes things and tells his story are not fully able to convey what he had in mind when writing a scene.<br/><br/>All in all this was an enjoyable read, but i left with the feeling that i would have hated this book if it would have been even 50 pages longer. I might give the second book a try, since the plot hook is good enough to keep me interested. But who knows...",,,1,0

It is character-driven to a point where you do not know why you bother reading this book in the first place. Usually, this would be the point where i tell you that the characters where so superbly written, that they convey the feeling of mystery, intrigue and or curiosity needed to keep you glued to the book. But sadly, this is not the case. The characters fall flat. This is mainly due to their behaviour not being consistent or not making any sense at all. Now, this does not have to be a bad thing if you actively incorporate it into your story and make the reader ask themselves ""Why on gods earth would x do y?"". But alas, it is not a case of adding to the mystery but (in my opinion) bad writing. <br/><br/>I repeat again: This book is lacking in intrigue and mystery. I only finished this book because it was not so utterly bad that i would not have felt bad for DNFing it. But the driving force is just not there.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. This is not the worst book ever written and the author is not without talent. If anything, i would say that the writing style is gorgeous. But the story and the characters were just not up to it. <br/><br/>At the end of the day, if you compare this book to Robin Hobbs or Joe Abercrombies works, it just is not all that good. Maybe it's a bit harsh to compare a book to some of the best authors in this space. But like i said, if you compare this work to the greats, you start to see that there is an enormous chasm in terms of quality inbetween. I really wanted to love this book, and the first half had me somewhat intrigued. But sadly it dissapointed in the second half.<br/><br/>I will probably read the next book just to see if the author can improve of the faults in the fist instalment. I have a feeling that this might be the case. Fingers crossed.",,,1,0

I loved the dark atmosphere and world-building, which combined an awesome firm magic system (kinda soft but with some rules attached, idk if that makes sense) with lovecraftian horror elements and placed those elements in a world that reminded me of the video-game Dishonored. The people living in this desolate hellhole are greedy, selfish, and more often than not, prone to violence and lots of cursing. Not a single person in this book is a shining beacon of morality, but i came to love them regardless.<br/><br/>This is a great book if you are looking for a relatively short book in the Dark Fantasy / Grimdark genres filled with death and misery.",,,1,0

To be frank i did not like one out of the three characters at first. I did not know why the heck we were learning about the life of a country girl. But after around 50 to 75 pages it all started to make sense. This book gives you three different angles by which you learn different things about the world we find ourselves.<br/><br/>Speaking of the world, this book is full of very creative ideas about how to use magic and deities. So much so that i will pick up the second and third book of this trilogy purely out of curiosity. I want to know what else this world has in store for me. The author really did a great job making this world feel plausible yet wildly different to ours.<br/><br/>The one thing i did not like about the book was the fact that it was a tad slow at some points. This, combined with the fact Krona and her eccentric informant did not get nearly enough pages in my opinion are the only reason i don't give this book 5 stars.",,,1,0

I do not like the fact that i was able to predict exactly <spoiler>which one of the main POV's would die a horrible death simply because they had a good heart</spoiler>. Abercrombie is, in my opinion, becoming too formulaic in this regard. Things only ever change but stay the same in the end. The wheels of progress grind forward, but people stay the same. No person of good intentions shall ever obtain what they wanted. Maybe the most shocking thing Joe could pull off (if he ever writes another First Law book) at this point is to let the good guys win.

Very creative swearing, granted. But probably three times more swearing than in other books nonetheless. <br/>- Violence is the solution to everything (due to the attitude of our main PoV).<br/>- Graphic torture scenes.<br/><br/><b>My two cents:</b><br/>This book is a lot shorter than the previous installment. It also dispenses with the metaphysical themes. We get a fairly straight forward tale of action, intrigue and betrayal.  But, the story is told from two perspectives. One is the 25-year-old Hari Michaelson during his breakthrough mission. The other perspective is the 50-something-year-old Caine (no, not Hari; Caine) being pulled into a hairy situation by one of his acquaintances.<br/><br/>The timeline from the past is well put together and gets resolved satisfyingly. The timeline from the present however feels a bit rushed. We get presented lots and lots of information, which explains the situation that Caine finds himself in. But sadly, the present timeline is somewhat rushed. It could probably have benefitted from around 100 or so more pages. Lots of characters, some of them supposed to be central to the narrative, are briefly introduced only to be never mentioned again or not play a role at all. Maybe this is due to set up for the last book. But still, not elegantly handled here.<br/><br/>Besides the issues of the present timeline, this book is somewhat of a return to form, like in the first installment. However, in terms of the feeling, the first novel was a standalone movie and this book is the third episode of an ongoing show. Much of what happens here is exposition, topped off with a giant cliffhanger. Would this series have ended after this book, it would have left a sour taste in my mouth.<br/><br/>The last point worth mentioning is that this is very much a Caine novel. The distinctive narrative voice is back, and it is great as always. Caine disrespects people, kills people, betrays people, just makes life miserable for people. All while doing it in a highly entertaining way (he is, after all, an actor). Action is always only a few pages away, and it is superbly written, as should be expected from a Caine book. <br/><br/>I hope that the last book is a step up from this novel. All in all this thing could have been longer, but after the last book i can't blame MWS for cutting down on the page numbers. A solid and enjoyable read, but not as good as the first two novels.<br/>",,,1,0

Also, it drops some f-bombs.<br/><br/>Whew. Where to start with this one. Blade of Tyshalle is very different from the first book, Heroes Die. Where the entry to this series was an action packed and bloody book about a hero trying to save his  ex-wife and topple a god-emperor in the same step, this book starts out a lot slower and on a more personal / emotional level.<br/><br/>Seven years have passed since Cain's last adventure and now Hari has to deal with the consequences of his actions. We get to see him as a broken man which is trying not to drown in self-pity, stripped from the one thing that made him whole: Cain. But we will also get to learn about his time at the acting-school and the people that he met there. How he grew up and just how messed up his childhood was.<br/><br/>While we get to observe Hari in his new life as head of his own studio, dark things are afoot in Overworld. Somehow, through mysterious ways a sort of super-rabies, long tought eradicated in our world, made it's way to the parallel dimension. The expected result: total annihilation of all things living. Somebody has to save the day. Who might that be? Hm...<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this book. While it is a sharp break from the first installment, i absolutely loved the more philosophical aspects of this book. Without going into great detail, here are some aspects that i like the most:<br/><br/>- What if the collective humanity manifested its own deity? How would that god look like in a capitalist hellhole ruled by a rigid and brutal caste-system embedded into corporate authoritarianism ? Probably not very pretty.<br/><br/>- How do you deal with grief when you are at your lowest point? What do you do when everything was taken from you and you still discover that things can get much worse?<br/><br/>- A bleak yet frighteningly realistic depiction of our world if corporations would take over. This is what truly terrified me while reading this book. If society ever gets as bad as this book describes it, we are all better off dead.<br/><br/>- Hope. After all the truly despicable and terrifying things that happen to Hari / Cain, there is still a very subtle undertone of hope in this book. Just the slightest ray of daylight to inch towards to.<br/><br/>All in all this book is far more emotional and deep that you would have expected when reading the predecessor.

It is a masterpiece of storytelling that combines multiple POV's and timelines and strange ideas into something that is far bigger than the sum of its parts.<br/>",,,1,0

This book ramps up from boring to edge of my seat in 500 pages.<br/><br/>First, let's something straight: There is literally not a single page of space combat. None. Nada. Zero. So the blurb is a fucking lie.<br/><br/>On to my toughts: The characters started out bland and generic but grew on me during the first 200 pages. Once the first big plot twist hits, i started being concerned for them. So far so good. We have four POV, two primaries and two secondaries which are very sparse. Sanda and Biron, our main POV's are likeable characters trust into the deep end and struggling to make sense of political intrigue and being the only human left alive in the system. One problem i had with Biron is that he was written in the style of ""tell, don't show"". We are led to believe that he is a shrewd politician and brilliant orator. But we do not get any example as to why. I hate that kind of writing. But i had very low expectations for his character, so he still managed to positively surprise me. The book also has quite the number of plot twists and a good mystery at the core of it all, which makes for an interesting read.<br/><br/>Did i miss something from the book? Space fights... Like it was advertised to have. This is definitely not my book of the year but i did enjoy reading it quite a bit.",,,1,0

This book improves on every aspect of its predecessor and is overall just a really enjoyable reading experience. On with the review.<br/><br/>The War Eternal relies on two key narrative aspects.<br/>First, Eskara is a headstrong and bitchy character. She has enough introspection to be aware that she can be a fucking idiot most of the time, but not enough restraint to change her behavior. Her drive and ambition will often force her to chose between the people she loves and her lust for revenge. And let me just add to this point that i really enjoy reading a headstrong female character that knows exactly what she wants and will strange god with her bare hands to get it.<br/><br/>Secondly, Eskara tells us her story while sitting in a cozy chair (presumably) in the afterlife (presumably) and sporadically gives us glimpses into the future. This creates a certain expectation, because we know some of the things that will happen, but not how or when.<br/><br/>The first installment fell flat on capitalizing on these two pillars. The conversations were wooden and everything felt lifeless. This prevented me from getting invested into the characters and their choices. Furthermore, all the hard choices made by Eskara were cheapened by the setting. If you are at the end of your luck and stuck in a hellhole where everyone is a horrible and broken person, nobody will care if you have to destroy people or chose power over people. You do not have to sacrifice anything.<br/>In this book however, Eskara is surrounded by people that she loves and values. She has a posse of her own, and she grows fond of them. As a consequence, you can sense the tension whenever she has to choose whether to sacrifice her friends for her own goals or not.<br/><br/>The second pillar also works out way better because we are now not confined to a dark dungeon anymore. Eskara now has tools to her disposal that help her grow and develop her power further. While the first book was a mad scramble for survival, this one has a lot progression. And with that progression comes a lot of worldbuilding and background information and subsequently, character growth.<br/><br/>And lastly, Rob really stepped up his character game. The conversations and character interactions are on a whole new level. No longer do we have to suffer through wooden conversations. This helps the book a whole lot.<br/><br/>It is also important to mention that the first fourth of the book is a bit slow. But once it gets going fun is guaranteed.",,,1,0

But this book deserves it. Seldom have I read a book with such a unique and entertaining character. Notker is witty and quick on his feet. He constantly makes the best out of the worst situations by sheer luck and cunning. And his commentary on the situations he gets himself into are just *chefs kiss*.<br/><br/>If you like snarky and sardonic points of view, this book is for you. The style is first person and very self-centered. Other characters are supporting and live in the backend of the story. However, it is not devoid of live and organic conversations as other such books. In fact, the conversations and Notkers commentary are what make this book so great.<br/><br/>And boy oh boy.

Do you like bitchy characters? Do you like characters that know that they are headstrong and bitchy but do not care? Then this book is for you!<br/><br/>The story is told from the first-person perspective of our heroine looking back on the good old days when she was thrown into a hellish prison and tried to escape. Sentenced to a life of misery and forced labor in an underground prison, for the crime of being a powerful mage playing for the wrong team (which lost the war).<br/><br/>Eskara, our protagonist, is a thick-headed and unrepentant asshole who always wants to have it her way. And you will love her for it. She is written with a very distinct authorial voice and it fucking WORKS damnit. As mentioned before, you get to hear her tell the story as an older woman. Everything she tells you lies in the past and you get to hear the occasional reflection on the folly of her youth. No sugarcoating here, she is as brutal with herself as she is to others.<br/><br/>The book itself is very short (by my standards). Only a bout 300 pages. Which means you have to cut out a lot of stuff so that you can actually tell a compelling story. And that is exactly what Rob J Hayes did here. Lots of details are omitted. Everything is cut right down to the necessary. Which works fine. But the one thing that did not work for me in this book is the narrow focus of the narrator. What do i mean? Well... Eskara is a self-centered asshole. Which is cool. But it is also a problem. Everything you read is about HER. This story is very anemic when it comes to interactions with other people. No meaningful conversation happens between her and the rest of the world. All the interesting stuff happens when she tells you what happened to HER and what SHE was thinking in that moment.<br/><br/>Suffice it to say that this is as far removed from Abercrombie-style endearing character interactions as you can get. And as much as i love our protagonist, i really really missed the interactions with the other people surrounding her. Because of that i could not really give this book 4 stars. <br/><br/>But, don't get me wrong. It still is a highly enjoyable read. It has lots of interesting story-hooks. The magic system is really cool and (for me) novel. The setting also works well. Although in the end the pit is just another backdrop to Eskaras story and not really a focal point of the narration. This story could have taken place in a meadow as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>Ok, time to wrap up before i start rambling. This book is good fun and i will definetly finish the rest of the trilogy.",,,1,0

Not a must-read for fans of the Unhewn Throne series but very entertaining nonetheless.<br/><br/>Ok, after finishing this book i was actually sad. As always, Brian excelled in the world building aspects and it really shows whenever he describes the city of Dombang or  the excentric worshipers of the god of Death (also known as Skullsworn, but don't call them that to their face :p ).  Whenever i am enjoying the exposition and anticipating the next tidbit of lore about the world and the people that live in it, i can tell that the author did a great job. Now, why does that make me sad? Because i was really invested in this story by virtue of being immersed in the world. And then someone dropped the ball in the plot department. At the beginning i was expecting a story full of plotting, scheming and then killing. However, it devolved more into some sort of romance / adventure book. Don' get me wrong, i love adventure and i think romance can be a great plus to any story if done right. But this book sets you up for one thing and then takes a hard left and gives you something else. Also, as with the Chronicles of the Unhewn Throne, i get the feeling that something was missing. That little extra oomph to the story. The extra sprinkle of the stuff that makes a story memorable and GREAT. I expected there to be a little bit more to the plot, but in the end it was very straight forward and maybe even a little bit boring.<br/><br/>Now, my ranting aside, let's look at worked in this book:<br/><br/><b>The Sidekicks</b>: The Pyrre we get to know in this book is far from what we see in the preceding trilogy. It makes sense. She is, in a sense, only just beginning her journey. Nevertheless she felt bland and uninteresting. Her sidekicks however where great. It was endearing reading her companions engaging in some great back and forth banter. I would pay good money to read a story focused on just those characters. If Pyrre had the same energy and feeling, this book would have been a 4/5.<br/><br/><b>The World building</b>: Like i already said, Brian is a master of creating interesting places, cultures and organizations / cults. We get a closer look into the Skullsworn and the history of the particular region this story takes place in. I loved it. Great execution. Give me more.<br/><br/><b>A bit of horror</b>: Close your eyes. Imagine you are at the docks of a crime-ridden city in the middle of the Amazon. Every single animal out there is out to get you. Rebellion is in the wind. And you get that feeling that something is watching. Something... strange. Something frighteningly out of this world. This mental image gave me a hint of horror and suspense  that enhanced the story. Sadly, Brian did not capitalize on this aspect. But it's nice nevertheless. <br/><br/>What did not work:<br/><br/><b>The execution of the plot</b>: The plot is, at least in theory, very interesting to say the least. But this book did not capitalize on it. Like i said before, it devolves into an adventure book. I did not like that. I feel like this book should have been a more grimdark tale of assassination and scheming combined with the humor of the sidekicks. But alas, t'was not. I suspect that this opinion is highly subjective and other people might not have had that feeling.<br/><br/><b>Pyrre</b>: Pyrre from the preceding books is highly interesting. Pyrre in this book is as interesting as a glass of water. She only really starts to become the ""old"" self we know and love in the last few pages of the book.",,,1,0

But by the end i wanted to give it 3 stars. So i'm going to compromise with 4.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the story. Subjectively, this series was really good. However, there where a few things that prevent me from giving it 5 stars with a clean conscience. I think Brian has to work on his endings. The end to this series left a bitter taste in my mouth. Also, the characters and plots where inconsistent. Apart from that, i really enjoyed the story and world-building. Can't wait to get into Skullsworn.<br/><br/>The good:<br/>- The pacing was solid.

This is not a slog where you will spend 400 pages on the same topic / story strand.<br/><br/>- The cultures. Brian Staveley really sold me on the Kettral and the disciples of the god of death. So many details and interesting facts. He really put effort into the inner workings of these organizations / cults.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/>- If the story strands are spaghetti then Brian dropped them all over the floor. At the very end i felt like we left a lot stuff unfinished. <br/><br/>- Chekhov's gun (more like Chekhov's atom bomb, amirite?).

So i completely forgot how much fun a cleverly written book of this genre can be. This thing is just the right amount of snark and witty social commentary on the perils of capitalism. Even tough this book is fairly short it nevertheless manages to endear me to all the protagonists of this book. And hate all the greedy bastards that run the show. If you look for top shelf banter and clever ideas COUGH pocket goblins COUGH this book is for you. <br/><br/>This book clearly follows the philosophy that it's not about the destination, it's about the journey. Which means that the plot is really just a device to deliver you funny lines and character growth. Which works out really well. Unless you really need that plot fix. But since i love Joe Abercrombie i guess i am not one of those.<br/><br/>Read this fucking book, ok?",,,2,0

It became clear at an early point that this would be setup for the other two books. As a consequence, a lot of pages (and by a lot i mean almost all the pages) are used up for exposition of two of the tree characters. The third POV will probably be fleshed out further in the subsequent books.<br/><br/>Characterization is solid. Do not expect any Logan Ninefingers in this book, but suffice to say that our POV's are good enough to be invested in them.<br/> <br/>I really hope that this series takes the path of Jeff Salyards' Bloodsounders Arc.

As a result, this book drags on quite a bit. Nevertheless, it still has interesting characters and a somewhat decent plot that kept me going (even tho sometimes it felt more like labor than enjoyment).<br/><br/>Characters:<br/>I was surprised to find out that i really liked Obvar's character development. He takes over the interspersed first person narration from the first book and tells us his story. But sadly, like with all the other secondary characters in this series, the author really drops the ball. <br/>Most of the characters are fairly well written, but it seems like Anthony really wanted to avoid the overly complex story of Queen of Fire and trimmed away as much character development as possible to focus solely on Vaelin. None of the characters get the exposure and screen time that they deserved. Also, the high point of Blood Song, namely the comradery between the characters, is practically nonexistent. Oh, and i actually did not care for Vaelin at all during this book.<br/>In short: too much Vaelin, not enough of every body else. Good characters and not enough exposure.<br/><br/>Plot:<br/>Oh boy. In theory the plot was ok BUT: it felt like somebody took a few pieces out of the good old ""Plot-points"" box and smacked them together and connected the dots. The story is not original (which is by no means a bad thing) nor particularly well put together (which is far worse). The story almost felt like it reused the formula of Towerlord + Queen of Fire but stripped of all complexity and the pacing of a snail.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>Now, that might sound like this book is terrible, but it is not. It's an ok book. But there are many great books out there so i would much rather recommend that stands out than something that is just ""ok"". It is also worth noting that a lot of people seem to greatly enjoy this second installment in the saga of Vaelin al Sorna. So my opinion might not represent the majority. <br/>If Anthony Ryan ever writes a new book about Vaelin i will probably check it out in the hopes that it is as good as Blood Song was. But i think by now the books have proven that that might not be the case again.",,,1,0

Is it worth having ""better living standards"" if your entire culture and way of living (and your people) gets erased?<br/>* Cerebral and complicated webs of intrigue. Plots within plots.<br/>* A long-con revenge story.<br/><br/>But after just a few dozen pages the story falls flat. I blame the prose. The whole tale is told in an almost clinical and soulless fashion that never lets you build up any strong connection with the protagonist. I simply did not care for anything that happened to Baru or her co-conspirators. And i certainly did not care for the plot and the twists after a certain point. Betrayal? Meh. Defeat? Meh. Victory? Meh. The ONLY thing that got me excited was Baru's internal fight debating if she should risk getting out of the closet and confess love or not.<br/><br/>In terms of intrigue and schemes, i would say that, at least in the first half, it works. The author clearly spent some time thinking about the moves and countermoves. But in the end it just is not as interesting as it should be because i was never really invested in the stakes and the plot.<br/><br/>In the hope that the second book gets better, i will continue on with this series. But it the second one does not do it for me, i will probably just DNF and GTFO.<br/> <br/>",,,1,0

It is still an entertaining and quick read, but many of the things that it was going for where botched. <br/><br/>The book tries to humanize Gaunt but does a terrible job at it.<br/>The first half of the book (which is the way too long exposition and setup) felt like a slog.<br/>The second half was full of suspense but was rushed. I kept getting closer and closer to finishing the book and still the endgame had not begun. It was very predictable that the resolution of this book would be VERY rushed.<br/><br/>Apart from that the story overall is very interesting.<br/>Gaunt's development may be a dumpster fire but the rest of the Ghosts grew on me just a little bit more.

A disgraced knight now brigand meets a young girl that seems to be guided by an unseen hand. Together they travel to the lands, hoping to stop what seems to be the end of the world. But it seems that the the plague is not the only thing let loose on the world of man. Strange things are happening and even stranger creatures are walking amongst the living.<br/><br/><bold>My two cents</bold>: <br/>* The author does a great job at depicting contact with the otherworldly. You will be asking yourself at certain points in this book if you are reading a dream sequence or if this is really happening, sharing the point of view of a clueless character.<br/>Another strong suit is the fact that sometimes less is more. Details are omitted, and that can make strange things even stranger and scarier.<br/><br/>* Character development is is somewhere between good to very good. The knight grew on me just a little bit more than the girl. There are other characters during this story that will grow on you, but i would not consider them part of the main PoV's.<br/><br/>Closing thoughts: This book is a solid mix between the horror and medieval fantasy genres. It has strong characters and a strong plot. Depth and lengthy explanations are sacrificed for a fluid and steadily moving plot (but that should be expected from a book with this page count).<br/>Read it. You (probably) won't regret it.<br/>",,,1,0

Not break-neck, but there are no slumps or slow-downs of the story. The main character is well written and fleshed out just enough. All in all this is an enjoyable and quick read.<br/><br/>SPOILERS!!!!!<br/>Bonus speculation in case we get a follow-up:<br/><spoiler> If you know your 40k and you payed even a bit of attention during the novel, you will probably come to the conclusion that our PoV is unknowingly part of a Genestealer cult.

Some people love it, some people hate it.<br/>I personally loved it, but i still had to put it down sometimes because it frustrated me so much.<br/><br/>Why is this book furstrating you ask?<br/>1) It is extremly slow. <br/>2) Fitz is human.<br/><br/>You might ask how the second point is bad. But let me tell you: After reading so many fantasy books with overly intelligent / competent protagonists it is EXTREMLY frustrating having to read a character that is just as stupid and incompetent at things as the reader. Fitz learns the hard way. He learns by failing. And sometimes he just fails without taking away anything from it.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Having said that, this book is great! The story is told with great love to detail and coherency. Fitz is finally forced to confront reality and venture out with his Wit-bond Nighteyes. He will make difficult decisions and reunite with old friends. <br/><br/>And most importantly of all: This book will answer SO MANY questions the reader had about Fitz and / or some of his previous blunders ( or why  he is why he is ).<br/><br/>This is also a book that will probably make you cry if you are invested in the story.<br/><br/>4.5/5 I am absolutely STOKED to read the rest of this series.

But sadly, for me, it was just interesting and not riveting.<br/>I have heard this book be described as philosophical or even metaphysical. This is probably true. This book goes far beyond what other works would do to explain the inner workings of individual characters or even all of mankind. I quite enjoyed that.<br/><br/>The story is very well thought out. Interactions between different cultures and mindsets are handled with surety that speaks of a well fleshed out world. Political intrigue is ever present, even tho not to a point where you have to keep a pinboard to connect all the dots. In other fantasy books battle-scenes are the highlight of the part or chapter. Here it is debates and discussions. At one point in the last few chapters of the book i was on the edge of my seat because of a potentially game-changing debate. Also, over the course of the book the ominous feeling of looming catastrophe will get more and more intensive, even tho it is only vaguely hinted at.<br/><br/>One of the problems i have with the book is that half of the POV's feel inconsequential or even unimportant. This may or may not be set-up for the upcoming two books but still...<br/><br/>All in all a VERY interesting read, but it lacks that special something that makes me burn trough the pages. I am looking forward to see how the series evolves over the next few books.",,,1,0
